position at enron  dear mr . zadorozhny :  maxim philippov suggested that i write you . being a first - year mba student  at owen graduate school of management ( vanderbilt university ) with a finance  concentration , i am looking for a summer associate position at enron .  the area of my particular interest is enron ' s risk management products  ( commodity derivatives research and trading ) . graduating from novosibirsk  state university with major in physics , i am eager to apply my experience  with the use of theoretical and statistical physics techniques to the  managing of modeling processes and creating complex financial and trading  models . i strongly believe that my graduate education coupled with  undergraduate background in physics , solid work experience in finance and  proven entrepreneurial spirit will allow me to contribute to enron as a  summer associate .  i would really appreciate your advice regarding employment opportunities at  enron and would like to find out more about enron capital & trade resources  corp . i will call you within this week to follow up on my request .  thank you very much for your time .  sincerely ,  dmitri villevald  enclosure : resume  >  p . s . looking through an example of margin risk hedging at enron ' s web site ,  i think i found a small mistake there . url of this page is  ( producer  application )  the second sentence of the paragraph beginning with \\\" paradigm and enron  exchange . . . \\\"  states the following .  for example , if the actual margin is $ 1 . 25 / mmbtu for a given month , then  paradigm will pay enron $ 0 . 13 / mmbtu . alternatively , if the actual margin is  $ 2 . 00 / mmbtu , then enron will pay paradigm $ 0 . 62 / mmbtu .  i believe , if i am reading it correctly , the money should flow in the  opposite direction , namely :  for example , if the actual margin is $ 1 . 25 / mmbtu for a given month , then  enron will pay paradigm $ 0 . 13 / mmbtu . alternatively , if the actual margin is  $ 2 . 00 / mmbtu , then paradigm will pay enron $ 0 . 62 / mmbtu .  am i right ?  again , thank you very much for your time .  - resume . doc\",\n          \"Subject: fluid analysis
